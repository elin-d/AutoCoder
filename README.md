# AutoCoder
AI to auto-generate code

AutoCoder integrates OpenAI’s ChatGPT into a DevOps workflow to automatically generate code from GitHub issues. Using a custom script.sh, it retrieves issue content, generates relevant code snippets, and stores them as artifacts. This project demonstrates secure API usage, workflow automation, and reusable GitHub Action creation — showcasing the power of AI-assisted development in modern DevOps pipelines.
